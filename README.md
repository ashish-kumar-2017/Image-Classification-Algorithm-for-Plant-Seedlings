## 🚀 Quick Start  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
 - ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ashish-kumar-2017/Image-Classification-Algorithm-for-Plant-Seedlings.git
 
   cd Image-Classification-Algorithm-for-Plant-Seedlings


### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
To install the required dependencies for this project, run the following command:

 - ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3️⃣ Prepare the Dataset

 Organize your dataset into the following structure:

 - ```bash
   dataset/
   ├── train/    # Training images, organized by species
   ├── test/     # Test images
   └── labels.csv # Optional, for additional metadata

  
### 4️⃣ Run the Notebook

Open `Dsp2.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab** and follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Preprocess Images
- Resize, normalize, and augment the images to ensure they are ready for training.

#### Step 2: Train the CNN
- Train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the preprocessed images.

#### Step 3: Evaluate Accuracy and Visualize Results
- After training, evaluate the model's accuracy on the test dataset.
- Visualize the results, including metrics such as loss, accuracy, and confusion matrix.
